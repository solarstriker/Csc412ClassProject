  <h3>My Travels</h3>
  <p>I enjoy exploring new places, cultures, and meeting new people</p>
  <p>This is where I post about my adventures, my experience of travelling around the globe. For me, there are three cities that love the most so far</p>
  <p><em>"When we get out of the glass bottle of our ego and when we escape like the squirrels in the cage of our personality and get into the forest again, we shall shiver with cold and fright. But things will happen to us so that we don't know ourselves. Cool, unlying life will rush in." <br>-D.H Lawrence-</em></p>

          <p>Berlin, Germany’s capital, dates to the 13th century. Reminders of the city's turbulent 20th-century history include its Holocaust memorial and the Berlin Wall's graffitied remains. Divided during the Cold War, its 18th-century Brandenburg Gate has become a symbol of reunification.</p>

      <p>There was an Old Person of Prague,</p>

          <p>Prague, capital city of the Czech Republic, is bisected by the Vltava River. Nicknamed “the City of a Hundred Spires,” it's known for its Old Town Square, the heart of its historic core, with colorful baroque buildings, Gothic churches and the medieval Astronomical Clock, which gives an animated hourly show. </p>
